# Smartwheel Core

A powerful keyboard knob controller with GUI

## Why do I need it?

The main problem with keyboard encoders and standalone dials is that there aren't many features out of the box, but *they can be much, much more powerful than they are right now*. Have you seen those techy gadgets from Hollywood blockbusters that hackers use (like Q's fancy joystick from latest 007)? Smartwheel gives you the same functionality, but adapted for day-to-day use.

Smartwheel is written in Python/PyQt5, so it could be easily modded with custom plugins. There aren't many right now, but this project is in constant development - there will be more soon.

## Features

#### Universal keyboards/dials support

Smartwheel will work with any knob - no support from the vendor required

#### A wide range of addons

There will be a wide range of plugins: from Krita/PS integrations to small quality-of-life imporvements

#### Theming

Smartwheel is fully customizable (you can even create any keybinds if you want)

## We need your help!

I've started working on this project a while ago, but it turned out that it's too big: it won't be possible to finish it without your help. If you believe in this project and want to contribute, please DM me in Telegram (@sandwich_eater), I may miss activity from Github. Even small fixes, ideas or suggestions are very important.

## DIY knob

If you don't have a standalone dial, you may 3D print one: there is a Freecad model in `pad` folder. Sadly, some components don't fit, but I don't have time to fix it right now. DM me if you need the fixed case model.
