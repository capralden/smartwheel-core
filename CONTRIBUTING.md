# Contributing

Please contact me if you need any support or anything else, note that I may accidently miss your issue/pr on Github (it would be nice if you could write a email).

### Code

Please mark somewhere that you've taken a request/issue, otherwise someone may start doing it too!

### Issues

Just add flairs to your issues
